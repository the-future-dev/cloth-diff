# Summary of the paper

 benchmark for deformable object manipulation in reinforcement learning.

# Method

Nvidia FleX physics engine for realistic simulation of deformable objects

# List of experiments

The paper benchmarks several RL algorithms on SoftGym, categorized by their assumptions about state and dynamics knowledge:

- **Dynamics Oracle:** Cross-entropy method (CEM) with access to ground-truth dynamics and particle information.
- **State Oracle:** Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with access to either full or reduced state information.
- **Image-based Observations:** CURL-SAC, DrQ, and PlaNet, operating directly on image observations.
- **Pick-and-Place:** A model-free RL method for cloth manipulation.
