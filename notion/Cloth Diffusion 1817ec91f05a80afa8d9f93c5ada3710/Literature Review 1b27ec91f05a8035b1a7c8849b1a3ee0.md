- Brings the diffusion models for behaviour cloning.
- Brings up the environment (push-T).

    - pros: can converge faster and sometimes better
    - cons: for a vast data size it is not significant
    
    Experiments:
    
    1. choose weights from teacher â‡’ enforce learning of the Teacher Neural Network. With a double loss: 
    2. weight example importance based on difficulty; if too difficult: weight to zero. In case of Neural Network adjust the learning rate
        - interesting because of trembling in the end of pushing: weight based on how fast we go to goal state

- **Multi-modality**
