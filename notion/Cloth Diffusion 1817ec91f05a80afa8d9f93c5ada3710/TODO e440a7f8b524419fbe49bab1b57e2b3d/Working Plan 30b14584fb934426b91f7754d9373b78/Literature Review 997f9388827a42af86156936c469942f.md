- [x]  General Overview of Deformable Object manipulation
- [x]  Analysis of works in Imitation Learning

*which architecture? Diffusion | VLA | Transformers*

- [ ]  Literature Review on incorporating privileged information into the architecture:

*ex what was used for Text-To-Image?*

- [ ]  Benchmark definition

*Which task? One or multiple? -> dataset*

- [ ]  **A priori** Thesis Definition:
- Which privileged information: *3D representation, also other things?*
- Which real Robot? Which Simulator?
- Which model architecture? *Pre-trained model exist?*
- Is data collection involved? How? *Dataset: RGB, Privileged info, action info*
