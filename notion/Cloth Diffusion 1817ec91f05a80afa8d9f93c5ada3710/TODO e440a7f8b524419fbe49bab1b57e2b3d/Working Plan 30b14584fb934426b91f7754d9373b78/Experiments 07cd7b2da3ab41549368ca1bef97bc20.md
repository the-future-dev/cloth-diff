# Experiments

Description: Implementing baseline models and collecting demonstration datasets in both simulated and real environments.
: 3
Status: In progress

**Experiment 1**: *testing if there is a faster convergence for the policy*

**Experiment 2**:

- **Ex1** high convergence: *train a very big and very general policy, language conditioned exploiting fast convergence.*
- else: â€¦

- [ ]  Dataset Collection: store on hf (*does KTH have a repo?)*
- What is enough data?
- Sim | Real
- Privileged | Non Privileged
- how split into => Training | Test | Validation

- [ ]  Training
