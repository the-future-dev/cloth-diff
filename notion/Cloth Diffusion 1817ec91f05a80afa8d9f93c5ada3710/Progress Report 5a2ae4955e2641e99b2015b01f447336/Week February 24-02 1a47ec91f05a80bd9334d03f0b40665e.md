## Paper reading: “multimodality”

Overview: Multimodal learning

- [ ]  Semplice
- [ ]  Attention

## Diffusion Policy

*why?* Start playing with models

- [x]  lerobot library to test training of diffusion policy against PushT environment

## First model playground

- [ ]  “mock” model setup
- [ ]  benchmark execution
- [ ]  3D diffusion policy:
    - [ ]  reimplementare il baseline Tax3D
- [ ]  Track Dis
    - [ ]  come introdurre nel nostro environment
